OpenAPI integration for Engine API capability metadata.

This module provides two functions:

* :func:`inject_capability_extension` walks a FastAPI app's effective route contexts, reads the
  :class:`~agentmesh.engine_api.capabilities.CapabilityFlags` attached by the
  :func:`~agentmesh.engine_api.capabilities.capability_flags` decorator, and
  writes them into the generated OpenAPI document as the ``x-capability-flags``
  extension on each operation object. The shape matches
  ``docs/studio/openapi.yaml``.

* :func:`derive_studio_client_allowlist` reads a generated OpenAPI document and
  returns the sorted list of ``operationId`` values whose
  ``x-capability-flags.runtime_mutating`` is ``false``. This is the function the
  Epic 1d CI invariant test calls to machine-derive the read-only Studio client
  allowlist (no hand-maintained route list).

**Hook timing.** :func:`inject_capability_extension` overrides ``app.openapi``
with a wrapper that generates the schema via the app's existing generator and
then injects the extension. It is safe to call once, after all routes are
registered and before serving. The generated schema is cached on
``app.openapi_schema`` by FastAPI, so injection happens on first access.

**Failure mode.** If a route is included in the OpenAPI schema as an operation
but its endpoint carries no attached flags, :func:`inject_capability_extension`
raises :class:`ValueError`. Failing loudly here makes it impossible to ship a
Studio surface with an unknown-flag endpoint.

FastAPI is imported lazily inside :func:`inject_capability_extension` so this
package imposes no hard import-time dependency on FastAPI.
