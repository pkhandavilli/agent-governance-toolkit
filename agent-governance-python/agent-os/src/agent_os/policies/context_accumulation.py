"""Post-execution accumulation and decision integration for CAG.

Sensitivity accumulates from the *actual* labels an action produced (its
``result_labels``), never from a projection of an output that has not run yet.
After folding, the next action is gated against the accumulated envelope.

The governance-level ``constrain`` outcome carries explicit obligations for the
host to enforce before the next action.
