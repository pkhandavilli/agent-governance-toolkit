"""No verdict consumer may drop a transform.

``transform`` is a permitting verdict: ``NativeAdapterResult.allowed`` is
``True`` for it. It permits a *rewritten* action though, carrying the
replacement in ``transformed_value``. A gate written as
``if not result.allowed: raise`` therefore forwards the ORIGINAL value while
the policy believes it was rewritten, so a redaction policy silently does not
redact and nothing reports a failure.

Every consumer must do one of two things:

* apply the replacement (read ``transformed_value``), or
* refuse, by gating on ``permits_unchanged`` or checking ``transform``.

The first test below is a census rather than a checklist. An earlier version
listed the known gates by name, which meant it could not catch a consumer
added somewhere new, and two live ones outside ``integrations/``
(``mcp_gateway`` and ``trust_root``) went unnoticed because of exactly that.
This walks the package instead, so a fourteenth site is caught wherever it is
written.

The census is structural and a determined no-op could satisfy it, so the
behavioural tests that follow drive the two sites that had nowhere to put a
replacement and confirm they refuse rather than forward.
