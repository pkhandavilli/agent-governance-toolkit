# Nono Sandbox Provider Design

`NonoSandboxProvider` uses Landlock on Linux and Seatbelt on macOS through
`nono-py`. Each execution runs in a fresh child process with an explicit
capability set.

## Configuration

`NonoConfig.from_sandbox_config` maps timeout, mounts, environment, and
network controls. Network access is blocked by default. Filtered egress starts
a proxy with `allowed_hosts`. Unrestricted egress requires explicit default
allow.

Nono has no tool-registration channel, so a non-empty `tool_allowlist` is
rejected. CPU and memory controls remain the operating system's
responsibility.

## Native governance

An optional `AgentControl` is wrapped in `HostSession`. Runtime and
static-scan denials occur before `sandboxed_exec`.
