# MXC Sandbox Provider Design

`MxcSandboxProvider` drives the native MXC executable and keeps no long-lived
sandbox process. A session owns a workspace whose scripts are mounted
read-only and whose output directory is mounted read-write.

## Configuration

`MxcConfig.from_sandbox_config` maps timeout, mounts, environment, and network
controls into MXC JSON. Filtered egress uses `network.allowedHosts`.
Unrestricted egress requires explicit default allow. Protected mount paths are
rejected.

MXC has no tool-registration channel. A non-empty `tool_allowlist` fails
session creation. CPU and memory limits are not represented by the stable MXC
schema and must be enforced by the selected containment backend.

## Native governance

`create_session(..., runtime=runtime, config=config)` stores an
`HostSession`. Every `execute_code` call evaluates before the static
scan and before MXC is spawned.

## One-shot execution

`run_once` creates a session, executes once, and destroys the workspace. Use
the full lifecycle when multiple calls must share output files.
