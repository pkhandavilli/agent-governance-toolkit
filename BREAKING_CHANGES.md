entries appear first.

## `HostSession.post_tool_call` and `pre_model_call` emit the adapter snapshot shape

**Date:** TBD

**Affected**

- manifests binding `post_tool_call` to `$.tool_result`
- manifests binding `pre_model_call` to `$.request`
- anything constructing `HostSession` directly rather than going through an
  `agent_os.integrations` adapter

**What changed**

`HostSession` sent the tool result as a bare value and nested the model request
under `request`, while the `agent_os.integrations` adapters send `tool_result`
as `{"value": ..., "error": ..., "duration_ms": ...}` and spread the model
request over `model`, `messages` and `tools`. Because those two seams
disagreed, no manifest could bind a policy target that resolved for both:
whichever seam the policy author did not target failed closed with a
missing-path error.

`HostSession` now emits the adapter shape at both points, which is also the
shape AGT-SNAPSHOT-1.0 §2.6 specifies.

This aligns `HostSession` with `agent_os.integrations` only. Other SDK entry
points, including `AgentControl.run_tool` and the LiteLLM adapter, still send
the older flat `tool_result` and are not covered by this change.

**How to update**

Repoint the affected policy targets:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `$.tool_result` | `$.tool_result.value` |
| `$.request` | `$.messages` (or `$.model`, `$.tools`) |

A manifest left on `$.tool_result` still loads and still returns a verdict. It
matches against an object rather than the result value, so a rule written for a
string stops denying. Repoint it before upgrading.

## `agt.policies` is removed; hosts call the ACS runtime directly

**Date:** TBD

**Affected**

- anything importing `agt.policies`
- hosts relying on the wrapper's approval-timeout default
- audit records keyed on the `policy:` reason-code prefix

**What changed**

`agt.policies` wrapped the ACS runtime to re-expose it under AGT names. The
wrapper is deleted and every module now calls
`agent_control_specification` directly. The `agt` package keeps only the CLI,
including the v4 migration tool.

The following public symbols are removed:

- runtime and manifest: `AgtRuntime`, `AgtManifest`, `AdapterRuntimeSession`,
  `AdapterManifestContract`, `ManifestCompatibilityError`, `ManifestProvenance`
- results: `PolicyEvaluation`, `ApprovalDecision`, `PolicyAuditRecord`,
  `TransformResult`, `EvidenceResult`
- snapshot builders: `SnapshotBuilder`, `agent_startup_snapshot`,
  `agent_shutdown_snapshot`, `input_snapshot`, `output_snapshot`,
  `pre_model_call_snapshot`, `post_model_call_snapshot`,
  `pre_tool_call_snapshot`, `post_tool_call_snapshot`

**Replacements**

| Removed | Use instead |
|---------|-------------|
| `AgtRuntime(path)` | `AgentControl.from_path(str(path))` |
| `AdapterRuntimeSession` | `HostSession` |
| `AgtManifest` | `parse_manifest` / `validate_manifest` |
| `PolicyEvaluation` | `InterventionPointResult` and `Verdict` |
| `ApprovalDecision` | `ApprovalResolution` |
| `*_snapshot()` helpers | `SnapshotBuilder` from `agent_control_specification` |
| `evaluation.is_allowed()` | `result.verdict.decision.permits` |

**Three deliberate behaviour changes**

1. Reason codes lose the `policy:` prefix. A Pydantic validator on the wrapper
   added it; the engine never emitted it. Anything matching on `policy:` needs
   updating.
2. `agt validate` now applies the runtime's own contract, so a manifest with no
   intervention points is an error rather than a warning.
3. The approval timeout moved onto the session. `HostSession` defaults to 300
   seconds and denies on expiry; pass `approval_timeout_seconds` to change it.
   The manifest's `approval.timeout_seconds` does not drive this. The core
   treats that section as opaque host configuration and `AgentControl` does not
   surface it, so a host that declares it in the manifest must pass the same
   value to the session until the SDK exposes an accessor.

## acs-generator is now a CLI-only package

**Date:** TBD (next `acs-generator` release)

**Affected:**

- `acs-generator` top-level Python imports such as `GenerationEngine`,
  `GenerationError`, `FakeLanguageModel`, `LanguageModel`, and
  `OpenAICompatibleLanguageModel`

**What changed:**

`acs-generator` `0.4.0b0` no longer re-exports implementation classes from its
package initializer. The package remains the `acs` and `acs-generate` command
line artifact generator. Reusable artifact validation moved to
`agent_control_specification.validation`.

**Why:**

The generator is an authoring CLI, not the owner of reusable runtime-facing
APIs. Keeping validation in the Python SDK gives API consumers one supported
surface and prevents the generator package from becoming a second SDK.

**How to migrate:**

- Replace `from acs_generator import validate_acs_artifacts` with
  `from agent_control_specification.validation import validate_acs_artifacts`.
- Invoke generation through `acs` or `acs-generate`. Code that imported
  generator implementation classes must move to the CLI or maintain its own
  integration with the internal modules.
## The rest of the Python policy surface follows the rule model out

**Date:** TBD

**Affected**

- `agt-policies` (`agt.manifest_resolution`, `agt._harness.opa_runner`)
- `agent-os` (`agent_os.policies` evaluators, decisions, and conflict types)
- `agentmesh-integrations`
- The unreleased `cedarling-agentmesh` backend and its package extra

**What changed**

The entry titled "Python runtime policy APIs drop the pre-ACS rule model"
records the rule model itself, the conversion helpers, and the sandbox
policy-to-config helpers. What goes here is everything that depended on them
and could only leave once they had.

Manifest resolution is gone as a module. It walked a folder tree, merged the
documents it found, and filtered them by scope, all of which described a
layout the ACS manifest does not have. `resolve_manifest`, `discover_policies`,
`merge_documents`, `filter_by_scope`, `ResolutionError`, and `ResolutionReason`
go with it, along with the `agt._harness.opa_runner` module. Point `AgentControl`
at a manifest instead.

`agent_os.policies` loses the evaluators and backends that read the rule model
(`PolicyEvaluator`, `ExternalPolicyBackend`, `ConcurrencyStats`), the decision
and conflict types they produced (`PolicyDecision`, `CandidateDecision`,
`PolicyCheckResult`, `PolicyConflictResolver`, `ConflictResolutionStrategy`,
`ResolutionResult`), and the remaining rule types (`PolicyRule`, `PolicyScope`,
`Condition`). Names that survive elsewhere are unrelated: `agent_os.base_agent`
keeps its own `PolicyDecision` enum, `agent_os` re-exports a `PolicyRule` from
`agent_control_plane`, and `agentmesh.governance` keeps a separate trust-policy
system that was never part of the v4 language.

Framework integrations lose their local policy surfaces: `GovernancePolicy`,
`GovernancePolicyChecker`, `GovernanceComponent`, `GovernanceSkill`,
`GovernanceToolset`, `PolicyGuardrailConfig`, `PatternType`,
`ShellPolicyViolation`, `load_policy_yaml`, `governed_shell`,
`policy_input_guardrail`, and `content_output_guardrail`. Each took a local
policy object; each now takes an `AgentControl`.

The `cedarling-agentmesh` backend and `CedarlingBackend` are removed with the
consolidated package extra that pulled them in. The backend implemented the
deleted backend contract and was never released.

**Migration**

Build the manifest with `agt migrate`, construct `AgentControl` from it, and
pass that wherever a policy object used to go. Read `evaluation_result` and
the ACS audit record in place of the compatibility exception fields.

---

## Rust and Mastra framework policy surfaces now use ACS manifests

**Date:** TBD

**Affected:**

- Rust `agentmesh::FrameworkGovernanceAdapter`
- `@microsoft/agentmesh-mastra`

**What changed:**

The Rust framework adapter no longer accepts its local policy struct and
pattern enum. It accepts native `AgentControl` or `Manifest` input. The Mastra
wrapper no longer exports a local policy middleware. It requires a Node ACS
`AgentControl` and delegates tool execution to `runTool`.

**Migration:**

Move tool catalogs, bindings, budgets, content policies, and approval rules
into an ACS manifest. Rust callers construct `AgentControl::from_manifest` or
`FrameworkGovernanceAdapter::from_path`. Mastra callers pass
`AgentControl.fromPath(...)` as the `control` option to `createGovernedTool`.

---

## Python runtime policy APIs drop the pre-ACS rule model

**Date:** TBD

**Affected**

- `agent-os` (`agent_os.policies`, `agent_os.integrations`, `agent_os.compat`, `agent_os.providers`)
- `agt-sandbox` (`agent_sandbox`)
- `agt-policies` (`agt.policies`, `agt._harness`)
- `agent-marketplace` (`agent_marketplace.hooks`)

**What changed**

The Python runtime no longer carries its own rule model, its own evaluators and
external backends, or the bridge that translated between that model and ACS.
The ACS runtime evaluates policy, so the parallel model and every helper that
converted between the two are gone rather than deprecated. Framework
adapters take an `AgentControl`. Sandbox providers take `runtime=` alongside an
explicit `SandboxConfig` instead of deriving one from a policy document.

These 75 public names are removed. The list is computed from the export diff
against the merge base, not assembled by hand.

`agent_os.policies` (39):
`AsyncPolicyEvaluator`, `BackendDecision`, `BudgetPolicy`, `CedarBackend`,
`DynamicBudgetTracker`, `DynamicCondition`, `DynamicConditionEvaluator`,
`DynamicConditionType`, `OPABackend`, `PolicyAction`, `PolicyCondition`,
`PolicyDefaults`, `PolicyDocument`, `PolicyOperator`, `SandboxMounts`,
`SharedPolicyDecision`, `SharedPolicyEvaluator`, `SharedPolicyRule`,
`SharedPolicySchema`, `ViolationCategory`, `deny_blocked_pattern_input`,
`deny_blocked_pattern_memory`, `deny_blocked_pattern_output`,
`deny_blocked_pattern_tool`, `deny_blocked_tool`, `deny_confidence_threshold`,
`deny_drift`, `deny_human_approval`, `deny_max_tool_calls`,
`deny_not_allowed_tool`, `deny_policy_error`, `deny_timeout`,
`document_to_governance`, `get_effective_defaults`, `governance_to_document`,
`merge_policies`, `policy_document_to_shared`, `shared_to_policy_document`,
`to_policy_action`

`agent_os.integrations` (20):
`ADKPolicyConfig`, `AdapterRegistry`, `AdapterRuntimeBridge`,
`AsyncGovernedWrapper`, `BridgeResult`, `DetectionEnforcementAction`,
`DetectionModuleConfig`, `EscalationResult`, `GovernancePolicyMiddleware`,
`HumanApprovalRequired`, `MAFGovernancePolicyMiddleware`, `PolicyConfig`,
`PolicyHierarchy`, `PolicyInterceptor`, `PolicyTemplates`, `TransformOutcome`,
`compose_policies`, `get_runtime_bridge`, `override_policy`, `register_adapter`

`agent_sandbox` (8): `aca_config_from_policy`, `docker_config_from_policy`,
`hyperlight_config_from_policy`, `mxc_config_from_policy`,
`nono_config_from_policy`, `policy_to_mxc_json`, `policy_yaml_to_mxc_json`,
`policy_yaml_to_nono_config`

Elsewhere (8): `NoOpGovernanceMiddleware`, `NoOpPolicyEvaluator`,
`get_evaluator` (`agent_os.compat`); `get_policy_engine`
(`agent_os.providers`); `governance_to_acs_manifest` (`agt.policies`);
`evaluate_policy_cli` (`agent_marketplace.hooks`); `EvaluationResult`; and the
`agt._harness.opa_runner` module.

**A manifest must bind every intervention point the adapter evaluates**

The bridge rewrote an unconfigured intervention point to an allow, so a
manifest could bind nothing and every path still ran. The ACS runtime denies
it instead, with reason `runtime_error:intervention_point_unknown`, and the
adapters pass that denial through.

This bites on a minimal manifest. An adapter evaluates a fixed set of points:
`input` on every call, `pre_tool_call` on every tool call, `output` after
every response. A manifest binding only `input` therefore denies the tool and
output paths, which reads as the adapter being broken.

Bind each point the adapter uses. The Rust guidance in
`agent-governance-rust/agentmesh/MIGRATION_V5.md` says the same thing and
shows the shape.

Do not read the reason as "no policy here, carry on". A `post_*` block still
stops the result propagating even though the guarded action already ran, so
permitting an unconfigured `output` or `post_tool_call` forwards model
responses and tool results no policy was consulted about.

**A tool-call budget now counts one call differently**

The bridge reported the tool-call count *including* the call under evaluation,
so `max_tool_calls: 3` denied the third call and allowed two. The ACS runtime
reports calls already completed, so `max_tool_calls: 3` now allows three. The
bridge carried this as a compatibility override and recorded it as temporary.
A deployed policy therefore permits one more tool call than it used to. Lower
the limit by one to keep the behaviour you have.

**Migration**

Run `agt migrate` on a supported literal policy, then build an `AgentControl`
from the manifest it writes. Sandbox resources, mounts, network settings, and
tool exposure move into `SandboxConfig`. Read `evaluation_result` and the ACS audit
record where you used to read the compatibility exception fields.

## MuteAgentValidator now runs capability validators consistently and honors strict_mode

**Date:** TBD (next release of `microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit`)

**Affected:**

- `agent-governance-python` (`agent_control_plane.mute_agent`):
  `MuteAgentValidator.validate_request`, `MuteAgentValidator.validate_action`,
  `MuteAgentConfig.strict_mode`

**What changed:**

Three input-handling defects that silently weakened validation are fixed. Each
changes the outcome for inputs that previously slipped through:

1. **Dict-shaped requests are now validated.** `validate_request` previously ran
   a capability's parameter validator only when the request was an
   `ExecutionRequest` object (it gated on `hasattr(request, "action_type")`). A
   dict request carries `action_type` as a key, so validators were skipped and a
   dict request with dangerous parameters was approved. Requests are now
   normalized to a shape-independent view and validated the same way whether they
   are objects or dicts. A dict request that fails a validator is now rejected.
2. **`validate_action` now runs validators.** The lightweight
   `validate_action(action_type, parameters)` path previously ignored
   `parameters` and returned success on an action-type match alone. It now runs
   the matching capabilities' validators against `parameters` and can reject.
3. **`strict_mode` is now honored.** `MuteAgentConfig.strict_mode` was never
   read; out-of-capability actions were always rejected. `strict_mode=False` now
   allows well-formed out-of-capability actions (as documented), while
   `strict_mode=True` (the default) continues to reject them. Malformed or
   unrecognized `action_type` is rejected in both modes.

**Why:**

Validation strength must not depend on the in-memory shape of the request, a
config flag that was silently ignored, or which entry point a caller used. All
three were fail-open gaps in a validator whose job is to reject.

**How to migrate:**

- If you send dict requests or use `validate_action` and relied on validators
  being skipped, ensure your requests satisfy the capability validators.
- If you set `strict_mode=False` assuming it was inert, note it now relaxes
  out-of-capability actions; set `strict_mode=True` (the default) to keep strict
  enforcement.

## GovernanceLayer.check_alignment fails closed; get_audit_log(0) returns zero entries

**Date:** TBD (next release of `microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit`)

**Affected:**

- `agent-governance-python` (`agent_control_plane.governance_layer`):
  `GovernanceLayer.check_alignment`, `GovernanceLayer.get_audit_log`

**What changed:**

1. **A raising alignment validator is no longer treated as compliant.**
   `check_alignment` previously logged an audit event when a rule's validator
   raised but did not record a violation, so a validator that threw was silently
   reported as `aligned=True` with no violations. It now records a
   `validator_error` violation and returns `aligned=False`.
2. **`get_audit_log(0)` now returns an empty list.** A `limit` of `0` was falsy
   and returned the entire log (`self._audit_log[-0:]` is the whole list). It now
   returns `[]`. `get_audit_log(None)` still returns the full log; a negative
   limit now raises `ValueError`.

**Why:**

An alignment gate that reports a throwing validator as compliant is fail-open,
and a limit of `0` returning everything is a silent wrong result for any caller
that computes a limit which can legitimately be `0`.

**How to migrate:**

- If you relied on `check_alignment` returning `aligned=True` when a validator
  raised, fix the validator; a raise is now a violation.
- If you called `get_audit_log(0)` expecting the full log, pass `None` (or no
  argument) instead.

## KernelSpace fails closed when no policy engine is configured

**Date:** TBD (next release of `microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit`)

**Affected:**

- `agent-governance-python` (`agent_control_plane.kernel_space`,
  Layer 3 control plane): `KernelSpace`, `create_kernel`

**What changed:**

A `KernelSpace` constructed without a policy engine previously allowed every
syscall (fail-open), including `SYS_EXEC` tool execution. It now fails closed:

1. **External syscalls are denied by default.** With no `policy_engine`,
   syscalls that reach outside the agent's own sandbox (`SYS_EXEC`, IPC,
   signal delivery, agent spawn) are denied. The denial is returned as a clean
   `SyscallResult(success=False)`; it does not raise a kernel panic and is not
   counted as a policy violation.
2. **Self-scoped syscalls stay allowed.** `SYS_EXIT` and the agent's own VFS
   operations (`SYS_READ`, `SYS_WRITE`, `SYS_OPEN`, `SYS_CLOSE`, `SYS_STAT`)
   remain allowed so an agent can still use its own memory and exit cleanly.
3. **New `permissive` parameter.** `KernelSpace(..., permissive=True)` and
   `create_kernel(..., permissive=True)` restore the previous allow-all
   behavior as an explicit, auditable opt-in.

**Why:**

For a governance kernel, a missing policy engine allowing arbitrary tool
execution is a fail-open trust-boundary hole. The safe default for a missing
governance dependency is to refuse externally-visible actions.

**How to migrate:**

If you construct `KernelSpace()` or `create_kernel()` without a policy engine
and rely on tool execution or other external syscalls, either wire a policy
engine or pass `permissive=True` to keep the previous behavior. Agents that
only read and write their own VFS and exit need no change.

---

## Policy engines: default-deny and consistent warn/log semantics

**Date:** TBD (next release of `microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit`)

**Affected:**

- `agent-governance-python` (`agent_os.policies`)
- `agent-governance-typescript` (`src/policy.ts`)
- `agent-governance-dotnet` (`AgentGovernance.Policy`)

**What changed:**

The three SDKs previously disagreed on authorization outcomes for the same
policy input. This release standardizes all three on fail-closed semantics:

1. **Default action is now deny.** When `defaults.action` is omitted, or when
   no policies are loaded at all, the decision is now `deny` in every SDK.
   - Python native ACS evaluation fails closed when no valid binding can
     produce a decision.
   - .NET: the zero-policy path now returns `PolicyDecision.DenyDefault`
     (previously `AllowDefault`).
   - TypeScript already defaulted to `deny`; no change.

2. **`warn` and `log` rules are advisory and still allow the request.** In
   TypeScript a matched `warn` or `log` rule now produces `allowed: true`,
   matching the existing .NET and Python behavior (previously TS denied them).

**Why:**

For a governance toolkit, an omitted default or an empty policy set producing
`allow` in one language and `deny` in another is a trust-boundary
inconsistency, not just a style difference. Fail-closed is the safe default.

**How to migrate:**

If you relied on the previous fail-open behavior (an empty or default policy
allowing requests), opt back in explicitly by setting the default action to
allow in your policy document:

```yaml
defaults:
  action: allow
```

No migration is required for consumers who already define explicit rules and
a default action.

## `agent-hypervisor` removes joint-liability, blockchain-commitment, and advanced-saga symbols

**Date:** TBD (next release of `microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit`)

**Affected:**

- `agent-hypervisor` (`hypervisor`)
- `agentmesh-runtime` (`agent_runtime`, which re-exported these symbols)

**What changed:**

The following public symbols are removed from `hypervisor` and from the
`agent_runtime` re-exports. Each backed a documented no-op stub (the ledger
always admitted, slashing and quarantine recorded events but enforced nothing,
the commitment engine stored in memory with no anchoring, and the saga DSL,
fan-out, and checkpoint modules had no runtime), so the removal is behavior
preserving:

- Joint liability: `VouchingEngine`, `VouchRecord`, `SlashingEngine`,
  `LiabilityLedger`, `LedgerEntryType`, `LiabilityMatrix`, `QuarantineManager`,
  `QuarantineReason`, `CausalAttributor`, `AttributionResult`
- Session intent locks: `IntentLockManager`, `LockIntent`,
  `LockContentionError`, `DeadlockError`
- Advanced saga: `FanOutOrchestrator`, `FanOutPolicy`, `SagaDSLParser`,
  `SagaDefinition`, `CheckpointManager`, `SemanticCheckpoint`
- Audit and clock internals: `CommitmentEngine`, `EphemeralGC`,
  `VectorClockManager`

**Why:**

These surfaces were Public Preview stubs that advertised capabilities the
runtime never applied, so keeping them exported implied enforcement that did
not exist. Public Preview status permits removal without a deprecation cycle.

**How to migrate:**

Remove imports of these symbols. The supported runtime surface is unchanged:
execution rings, session isolation, the hash-chained delta audit trail,
`SagaOrchestrator` (ordered steps, retries, timeout handling, and reverse-order
compensation), the kill switch, rate limiting, and observability.

---

## Composite action: `toolkit-version` is now **required**

**Date:** TBD (next release of `microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit`)

**Affected:**

- `microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/action`

**What changed:**

The `toolkit-version` input was previously optional and defaulted to the
latest published toolkit release at action-update time. That behaviour created
a silent supply-chain coupling: a compromised, yanked, or unintentionally
broken toolkit release could land in any consumer's CI on the next workflow
run, with no version pin under the consumer's control.

`toolkit-version` is now **required**, and the action validates the value
against a strict regex that accepts only `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y.ZaN`, `X.Y.ZbN`, and
`X.Y.ZrcN`. Floating refs (`3.7.*`, `>=3.7`), post-releases (`3.7.0.post1`),
dev-releases (`3.7.0.dev0`), local-version identifiers (`3.7.0+local`), URL /
VCS references, and environment markers are all rejected.

**Why:**

This closes a class of supply-chain finding raised during the
`jackbatzner/harden-ci-review-automation` review: an attacker who can
republish or yank a toolkit release should not automatically execute in
consumer pipelines, and the version pin must be explicit and auditable in
the consumer's repository.

**How to migrate:**

1. **Pin the action to the major tag you were already using.** The major tag
   (e.g. `@v3`) continues to point at the latest release within that major,
   so the toolkit-version requirement does not break your pipeline at
   action-update time:

   ```yaml
   - uses: microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/action@v3
     with:
       toolkit-version: "3.7.0"          # <-- now required
   ```

2. **Bump `toolkit-version` deliberately** when a new release ships. Treat
   it the same way you would a pinned npm or pip dependency: review the
   changelog and the release notes before bumping.

3. **Consider Dependabot** for the version-bump itself. `toolkit-version` is
   a string, so a small ecosystem-specific updater or a regex-based custom
   updater is the easiest fit.

If your workflow run fails with:

```
::error::toolkit-version must be an exact release or pre-release (e.g. 3.7.0 or 3.7.0rc1); got: ...
```

then the value you supplied does not match the accepted syntax. See
[`action/README.md`](action/README.md#accepted-version-syntax) for the full
list of accepted and rejected forms.

**Operational note:** the action's own version (`@v3`, `@v3.7.0`, or a
commit SHA) is independent of `toolkit-version`. Pinning the action to a
commit SHA is recommended for high-trust pipelines (see GitHub's
[hardening guide for third-party actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions)).
